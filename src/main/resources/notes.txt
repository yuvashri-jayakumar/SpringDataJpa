EntityManager	Low-level JPA API	Core JPA interface to interact directly with the persistence context (insert, update, delete, query).
JpaRepository	High-level Spring Data abstraction	Built on top of EntityManager — gives you ready-made CRUD methods, so you don’t have to write boilerplate code.

In short:

JpaRepository uses EntityManager internally.
